                A small independently run clothing company that aims to raise awareness of harshness of the shark finning industry by donating 5% of all the money we wake to various organisations that work hard to stop the shark finning industry.
                We were created in early 2020 in the back of a garage, armed with nothing but a silk screen of the design, a carousel to print on, and some inks.                
                Without sharks as apex predators, the entire ocean ecosystem could fall out of balance. 
                They not only maintain the species below them in the food chain, but also indirectly maintain seagrass and coral reef habitats.
                Without them, other predatory fish would reduce the numbers of herbivores, which in turn would allow algae to dominate over coral reefs.
